## The Api and model folder contains a nosql(mongodb) model and http RestAPI mocks

The Webpage is live at [Wysa-Sleep-Assessment](https://wysa-sleep-assessment.vercel.app/home)

I have used [Firebase (backend as a service)] to setup both database and authentication

# Challenge 1
## Estimated time - 1.5 hours
## Primary focus - API and data design, prototyping skills

Download the [Wysa for Sleep app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=sleep.app.relax.calm&hl=en_IN&gl=US)

Alternatively, you can also search for Wysa Sleep on the Google Play Store. Note that as of now, this app is not available for iOS, so you will have to either use the screenshots from below or borrow an Android phone for a short bit from a friend.

During the onboarding phase, the Sleep app takes you through a sleep assessment that looks like so.
 
Please go through the onboarding screens for a clear understanding of the task.

### Now implement the following:

1.	Design detailed REST API interaction flows (that include the request body, parameters and responses), and database schema (sql or nosql) that will be used to implement a flow like this. 
2.	Architect and implement a React project to implement the screen. 
a.	Support only 1 or 2 of the screens in the flow
b.	Ensure the switching b/w the screens is happening via a (mock) server


### Note: 
●	The api design is a REQUIRED task. Attempt the static code challenge on leetcode only after you’ve completed this. 
●	Please read the task description carefully before attempting.
Challenge 1 Bonus
You can choose to attempt the following as a bonus challenge. This can be completed in a day and submitted as a follow up to your first submission.

1.	Samples of how your storage is streamlined for analytics
2.	Implementation of a basic server that has the following
a.	A basic signup page - accepting a unique nickname + password pair should be enough
b.	APIs for interacting with the screens (screens can be very basic)
c.	Secure communication for protected endpoints
(Feel free to hardcode or add pseudocode where needed eg. the score created in the last screen)
